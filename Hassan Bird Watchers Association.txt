# Bird Watcher's Association App

# Description of the solution

This is a responsive angular app that fulfills all the criteria required by the assignment.
The bonus feature chosen is the geo location. This is implemented using JavaScript's Geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
method.



The flow of the app is as follows: 
Step 1) The user is prompted to allow the app to access the user's location, if this is allowed the geo location is saved with the entries.
An angular material dialog is opened for first time user's to enter their name.

Step 2 ) The main view is opened 
 
Step 3) Clicking the Add observation button opens the form.
 
Step 4) After successfully entering the details an entry is added to the list.
 
Step 5) Clicking the view Notes button opens a dialog displaying the note.
 


# Extra Features Implemented
- A stunning UI
- Popup prompting the user to enter their full name so that it can be saved with the observation
- Edit observations feature
- Popup for viewing notes
- Image placeholder (although upload image is not implemented due to time constraints)

# Experience Doing the assignment

I found the topic for this assignment extremely interesting and this made me want to add my own
ideas and enhancements after completing the required features. These include an edit observation feature,
a popup for viewing the notes, adding the scientific name of the bird and prompting first time users to enter their
name.
Given more time I would add unit tests as well as image upload. I would also add an Node.js server to save entries
to a database instead of utilizing the browser's local storage.
